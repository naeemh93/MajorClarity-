Approach Used For Solving the Assesement:

- For solving this problem i took offsite meetings to come first by sorting them 
  based on type so that the padding factor can be handled and after that the onsite 
  meetings can be entertained.  There can be some other Approach used by handling offsite
  later as well but this is what came in mind before solving the problem.
  

-  The minimum duration slot is of 0.5 duration in hours so i took this as 
   smallest possible meeting duration to make slots.
   
-  i created slots from 9am to 5pm by adding 30 mins slot time between each of them and 
    then checking conditons whether the meeting can be done or not in that time frame.
